# Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create a tool that can help split a set of keyword phrases into two headings, applying custom rules. 

The tool will be used to create advertisements on Yandex Direct. Its main purpose is to quickly transfer part of a long key phrase from the main title of an ad to the additional title to fit within the length constraints of the ad titles.

## Features:
1. The transfer of the key phrase will be done with whole words.
2. Prepositions will be transferred together with the words they are connected to.
3. The length of the ad titles can be set by the user in the settings.
4. If the transferred phrase does not fit into the length of two titles, it will be highlighted for the user's attention.
5. There will be an option to add an exclamation mark to the end of each key phrase.
6. There will be an option that lets the user specify a list of words or abbreviations to capitalize.
7. The user inputs the phrases as a list, with each phrase on a new line (imported from Excel).
